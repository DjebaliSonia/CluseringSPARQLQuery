Hierarchical clustering method :  for not empty set of SPARQL query results by querying a given RDF base this pour approach is composed following this four steps :

1. Retrieve in the RDF base the neighborhood result of each resource of result.
2. Generate all different possible maximal descriptive patterns based on allneighborhood results from step 1.
3. Data processing (cretaion of binary and n-aire matrix)
4. Hierarchic clustering (first we create corresponding matrix for input of clustering methods)
    1. DIANA Hierarchical Clustering
    2. AGNES Hierarchical Clustering
    3. Hierarchical Clustering on Principal Components
   
5. Cutting tree. Clustering results can be finally derived directly from the ob-tained hierarchy.
