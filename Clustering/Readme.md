Hierarchical clustering method :  for not empty setof SPARQL query results by querying a given RDF base is composed followingthis
four steps :

1. Retrieve in the RDF base the neighborhood result of each resource of result.
2. Generate all different possible maximal descriptive patterns based on allneighborhood results from step 1.
3. Data processing (cretaion of binary and n-aire matrix)
4. Hierarchic clustering 
    1. DIANA Hierarchical Clustering
    2. AGNES Hierarchical Clustering
    3. Hierarchical Clustering on Principal Components
   
5. Cutting tree. Clustering results can be finally derived directly from the ob-tained hierarchy.
